🧠 Why this is exactly right
“How does this program think?”
"What is this program even trying to accomoplish?"

  Well, I figured I would do a little experiment to see if i can get chatgpt help me code a little UI
  for the pimoroni pico explorer.

  I paired this device up with a raspberry pi pico W. Since the day I purchased this little device I knew that the
 demos given on the website werent enough. 

 I was in luck. This is the perfect device for that. I am really stoked to have one (my own money)

 I want to make a little UI that can let you navigate through a menu play a game or two and maybe more one day.
 (If My AHDH doesnt lock in on something before i finish this)

 Anyways all of that being said I will be leaving a whole bunch of comments within the code
 so if anyone could suggest me how to code better ...??...

 This is going to be "one of the fist" projects i do before i clean my github
